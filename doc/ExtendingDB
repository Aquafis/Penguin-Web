Developing out Database
-----------------------

### Preamble
The database for Penguin is a pretty simple setup. All user and blog data is stored
on a MySQL instance. Node.JS makes database interaction quite easy. For this project,
we primary use the Node module: `sequelize`, which is an ORM for a small set of
databases.

To edit or create new database schema, it's important to understand the layout of DB
access for Penguin. If you've taken note of the app layout, you'll notice there is a
`db/` directory in the `root`. This is where all the Node/Sequelize schema files are
and also the main DB file which contains the basic actions to control the schema.

### Implementation
In order to get your own schema up or to create changes in the schema, you'll have to
do a few simple things. The first is create a Sequelize schema object model under
/db/models/. 

Next is to extend your new model in the database library /db/db.js. Be sure to add
an object under `db.Models` to represent your schema, and them also be sure to create
the appropriate `Sequelize.import()` statement under `db._fetchModels()` so that your
newly written schema object is loaded into the library.
